# Intro  
This repository holds a bunch of scripts I wrote to make various videogame experiences more enjoyable. I mostly stuck with using GUI automation via the pyautogui module.   
  
## Neopets Automation  
 I try to automate some of the dailies I did in Neopets  
 
## Shop Wizard Automation  
 A script that opens a bunch of shop wizard searches--this is useful for finding out how to price various items in the store  
   
## Age of Mythology Automation  
 A script that types in the resource cheat codes in Age of Mythology. Useful for when I just want to mess around in singleplayer
